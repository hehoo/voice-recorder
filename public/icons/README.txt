PWA ICONS INSTRUCTIONS
====================

To generate the required icons for your PWA:

1. Open the placeholder.html file in your browser
2. Right-click on each canvas and select "Save Image As..."
3. Save the images with the following names:
   - icon-192x192.png
   - icon-512x512.png

Alternatively, you can create your own custom icons with these dimensions:
- 192x192 pixels
- 512x512 pixels

Make sure to save them in this directory with the exact filenames mentioned above.

These icons are referenced in the manifest.json file and are required for PWA functionality.
